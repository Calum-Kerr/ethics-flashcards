            <h2>Practical Ethics and Dialectic Method</h2>
            <p>Practical ethics connects principles or values to specific situations and considers arguments for various courses of action. The dialectic method examines situations to discover underlying ethical issues, creating a Socratic dialogue that helps determine the right or moral course of action.</p>
            
            <h2>Rules-Based Ethics</h2>
            <p>This tradition suggests that bad actions can be avoided through a set of rules, often derived from religious teachings (e.g., the Ten Commandments). However, these ancient rules can be difficult to generalise to complex ethical problems in modern computing, raising questions about the moral basis for devising rules for new situations.</p>
            
            <h2>Consequentialist Ethics</h2>
            <p>Also known as teleological theories, consequentialist ethics consider the consequences of an action as a measure of goodness. They contrast with deontological theories, which emphasise the rightness of an action above the goodness it produces.</p>
            
            <h3>Utilitarianism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluates actions based on their consequences for overall happiness</li>
                <li>The good of an action is in the utility it produces, not in the action itself</li>
                <li>Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote the greatest pleasure or happiness (John Stuart Mill, 1863)</li>
                <li>Distinguished by impartiality and agent-neutrality: everyone's happiness counts the same</li>
                <li>Key proponents: Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, David Hume, Francis Hutcheson</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Egoism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Puts an individual's interests above every other consideration</li>
                <li>Claims "I morally ought to perform some action if, and only if, and because, performing that action maximises my self-interest"</li>
                <li>Any action is good as long as it maximises an individual's happiness</li>
                <li>Differs from Utilitarianism in scope: considers only one's own good, not the good of others</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Altruism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>An action is right if it is favourable to all except the actor</li>
                <li>Altruistic acts need not involve self-sacrifice</li>
                <li>Reciprocal altruists display behaviour towards those from whom they have received it or expect to receive it</li>
                <li>Universal altruism, often seen as central to Christianity, is unconditional</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Deontological Ethics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>From Greek 'deon' meaning duty</li>
                <li>Stresses duties, rights, and ethics of actions per se</li>
                <li>Examines whether an action is morally right or wrong in itself, irrespective of consequences</li>
                <li>Importance is attached to the motive behind a decision</li>
                <li>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) is the most important proponent of deontological ethics</li>
                <li>Kant's "Categorical Imperative": principles that are intrinsically valid and must be obeyed in all situations if behaviour is to observe moral law</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Ethics in Practice</h2>
            <p>Different societies, organisations, and individuals have different moral values and ethical stances. There are few absolute rules, and individual belief sets may be inherited from family, friends, workplace culture, etc. This leads to "Ethical Relativism" - the idea that there are no absolutes. The dialectic method may not always lead to definitive conclusions but helps achieve objectivity and better understanding.</p>
