            <h2>Understanding the Digital Divide</h2>
            <p>The digital divide refers to the perceived gap between those who have and do not have access to "information tools" and between those who have and do not have the ability to use those tools (Tavani, 2016). It encompasses multiple divides: between nations (global), between rich and poor, educated and less educated, people with and without disabilities, and between genders.</p>
            
            <h2>Global Digital Divide</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>As of 2024, approximately 2.6 billion people (32% of the world population) remain offline</li>
                <li>96% of those still offline live in developing countries</li>
                <li>Internet usage grew by about 10% annually between 2005-2019, with a pandemic boost in 2020-2021</li>
                <li>Significant inequality exists between developed and developing nations</li>
                <li>In 2024, 93% of people in developed countries use the internet compared to only 27% in least developed countries</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Urban vs Rural Digital Divide</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Globally, 83% of urban dwellers use the internet compared to only 48% of rural inhabitants</li>
                <li>Even in Europe, there's a gap: 93% urban vs 86% rural internet usage</li>
                <li>Rural areas face higher infrastructure costs for connectivity</li>
                <li>Rural users often experience much poorer internet speeds</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The Digital Gender Gap</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Globally, 63% of women use the internet compared to 69% of men</li>
                <li>The gap is small in developed countries (92% vs 93%) but significant in least developed countries (21% vs 32%)</li>
                <li>Gender equality in internet use exists in only about 25% of countries</li>
                <li>In the Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, and Africa, the gender gap has been growing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Digital Skills Divide</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Illiteracy remains a major barrier to accessing information online</li>
                <li>In 40 out of 84 countries studied, less than half the population possesses basic computer skills</li>
                <li>More complex "standard skills" like using spreadsheet formulas or installing software are even less common</li>
                <li>In the UK, 15% of adults (6.8 million people) lack foundation digital skills</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Internet Speed Inequality</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Global average broadband speed has increased from 11.03 Mbps in 2019 to 55.38 Mbps in 2024</li>
                <li>However, speeds vary dramatically between nations</li>
                <li>Developed nations typically enjoy much faster internet connections</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Digital Exclusion in the UK</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>15% of UK adults lack foundation digital skills</li>
                <li>Those most likely to be digitally excluded are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Older individuals</li>
                        <li>Those living alone</li>
                        <li>People with lower levels of education</li>
                        <li>Those with impairments</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>People with impairments are 1.5-2.5 times more likely to struggle with online services</li>
                <li>Digital exclusion affects access to essential services like healthcare, benefits, and support</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Initiatives to Bridge the Digital Divide</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Universal Credit in the UK is "digital by default," highlighting challenges for the digitally excluded</li>
                <li>Scotland's Digital Inclusion Charter aims to promote digital inclusion across sectors</li>
                <li>Accenture's "Regenerative AI" initiative (2024-2027) aims to help over a million people build AI skills</li>
                <li>Charities like Good Things Foundation offer basic digital skills resources</li>
            </ul>
