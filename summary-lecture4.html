            <h2>Internet and Democracy: Two Perspectives</h2>
            
            <h3>Democratic Aspects of the Internet</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows individuals, civic groups, and journalists to produce and distribute information</li>
                <li>Often bypasses traditional mass media (e.g., spreading protest plans, crowdsourcing news)</li>
                <li>Facilitates interest group associations independent of geographical limitations (e.g., #metoo)</li>
                <li>Provides access to a broader range of information sources</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Undemocratic Aspects of the Internet</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One-to-many communication can be intercepted before reaching consumers</li>
                <li>Powerful institutions can use the internet to consolidate and gain new kinds of power</li>
                <li>Surveillance capacity lends itself to undemocratic or totalitarian uses</li>
                <li>Online experience is dominated by a handful of wealthy tech companies with limited responsibility</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Social Media Platform Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act (1996) effectively shields platforms from legal liability for user content. This has dissuaded platforms from removing offensive, obscene, or untrue content, giving them power without responsibility. Australia has taken legislative steps to require tech platforms to negotiate with news organisations to redistribute news and "level the playing field for public interest journalism."</p>
            
            <h2>Internet Freedom Globally</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Global internet freedom has declined for 12 consecutive years (as of 2022)</li>
                <li>Internet freedom largely mirrors democratic freedom</li>
                <li>China ranks lowest for internet freedom, followed by Myanmar and Iran</li>
                <li>Iceland ranks highest, with the US in 9th place, and the UK and Taiwan tied in 5th place</li>
                <li>Russia has experienced sharp decline, now in 5th lowest place</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Internet Censorship: Russia Example</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Roskomnadzor (RKN), Russia's media regulator, requires ISPs to install government-produced deep packet inspection systems</li>
                <li>This system blocks global social media, Ukrainian news sites, and domestic sites with dissent about Ukraine</li>
                <li>As of September 2022, around 1.2 million internet sites were blocked in Russia</li>
                <li>Russian authorities have expanded control over biometric data and use facial recognition to surveil activists</li>
                <li>Russia scores 21/100 for internet freedom compared to 78/100 for Taiwan</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Internet Shutdowns</h2>
            <p>Internet shutdowns are intentional disruptions of internet or digital communications to control information flow. They lead to economic losses and harm informal economies. Deliberate shutdowns cost the global economy $24 billion in 2022 following 114 major outages across 23 countries. Common methods include ordering ISPs to implement shutdowns, DNS poisoning, and Border Gateway Protocol hijacking.</p>
            
            <h3>Examples of Internet Shutdowns</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Iran: Following Mahsa Amini's death in 2022, authorities implemented multiple shutdowns to prevent protests</li>
                <li>Pakistan: Shut down internet during the 2024 general election</li>
                <li>Myanmar: Frequent shutdowns since the military coup</li>
                <li>India: Regular localised shutdowns during protests despite "Digital India" campaign</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>e-Government</h2>
            <p>e-Government refers to using ICTs to transform relations with citizens, the private sector, and other government agencies to promote empowerment, improve service delivery, strengthen accountability, increase transparency, and improve efficiency. It encompasses communication (online access to information), transaction (online payments), and relationship (public participation).</p>
            
            <h3>Taiwan's Open Government Example</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Taiwan ranks 6th globally for internet freedom</li>
                <li>Originated the "g0v" (gov-zero) movement for information transparency</li>
                <li>Implemented "participation officers" to increase openness across government agencies</li>
                <li>Four elements: transparency, participation, accountability, and inclusion</li>
                <li>Promotes citizen-led fact-checking and public opinion collation</li>
            </ul>
