Last lecture
•We examined several schools of ethical thinking which 
guide how we behave morally and how we view 
technology
This lecture
•We explore relationship between technology and society, 
focusing on the digital divide and reasons for digital 
exclusion, both globally and in the UK

This week’s lecture is about
•The global digital divide
•Digital exclusion around the world
•Difference in access speeds
•The digital skills divide in the UK

--- Page 6 ---

The global digital divide
•Tavani (2016) offers a working definition: “The perceived gap 
between those who have and do not have access to “information 
tools” and between those who have and do not have the ability to 
use those tools”
•Rooks and Weckert  (2007) described it as a “notoriously muddy 
term”, implying that the gap is troubling
•Suggests there are many “divides”:
ꟷbetween nations (global digital divide) and within nations
ꟷbetween rich and poor, educated and less educated, people with 
and without disabilities, men and women

in 2024, in billions (ITU, 2025)
•Between 2005 and 2019, the 
number of Internet users grew on 
average by 10% every year, with a 
pandemic boost
•The rising trend masks rising 
inequality between the developed 
and less developed world
•96 per cent of the 2.6 billion people 
still offline are living in the 
developing world (all figures from 
ITU, 2025)

Trends in global internet usage
•After years of steady growth, numbers rose considerably during a 
“pandemic boost” in 2020 and 2021; however, this was short -lived
•Inequality between the developed and less developed world means 
some users are rarely able to be online
•Poor connectivity and slow speeds
•Intermittent access to electricity
•Access is more expensive as a proportion of earnings
•The digital gender gap is growing fast in developing countries

--- Page 11 ---

The urban vs rural digital divide
•It is more expensive to convey the Internet to the scattered population 
in rural areas because of the high cost of infrastructure used for long 
distances, such as fibre optic cabling
•Despite the sharp rise in internet usage during the Covid -19 pandemic, 
the urban -rural gap remains severe  (globally 83% of urban dwellers 
compared to 48% of rural inhabitants) in 2024
•Even in Europe, 86% of rural dwellers against 93% of urban dwellers 
use the internet, often with much poorer speeds

The digital gender gap
•The proportion of women using the Internet globally is 63%, compared 
to 69% of men
•The gap is small in developed countries (92% vs 93%), larger in 
developing countries, most in Least Developed Countries (21% vs 
32%)
•The proportion of women using the Internet is higher than that of men 
in only 8% of countries, while gender equality in Internet use is found 
in just over one -quarter of countries
•In the Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, and Africa, the gender gap 
has been growing

Lack of skills a barrier to internet use
•A major barrier to accessing information on the web is illiteracy
•Another important barrier in the effective use of the Internet is a lack 
of ICT skills
•In 40 out of 84 countries for which data are available, less than half 
the population possesses basic computer skills such as copying a 
file or sending an e -mail with an attachment
•For more complex activities (classified as “standard skills”), such as 
using basic arithmetic formulae in a spreadsheet or downloading 
and installing new software, the proportions are even lower

Growth in global internet speeds
•Average global broadband download speed measured from 9 
May 2018 to 8 May 2019 was 11.03Mbps 
•Average speed in 2020 was 24.83 Mbps (first pandemic year)
•Average speed in 2021 was 29.79 Mbps
•Average speed in 2022 was 35.98 Mbps
•Average speed in 2023 was 46.79 Mbps
•Latest average global broadband speed in 2024 is 55.38 Mbps
•But fixed and mobile broadband speeds vary wildly between 
nations!

Foundation (most basic) digital skills
•In the UK today, 15% of adults aged 18+ are without the Foundation 
Level (i.e. they are either digitally disengaged or have Partial 
Foundation Level)
•Profiles of the digitally disengaged have demonstrated that those most 
likely to be in this group are:
−Older individuals
−Those living alone
−People with lower levels of education
−Those with impairments

Perceived benefits of digital skills
•A comprehensive recent survey (Lloyds Bank, 2024) indicated that, despite the 
fact that 99% of people have used the internet at least once in the past three 
months, 15% (6.8 million people) of the UK population are unable to do some 
of the most basic digital tasks. They are likely to struggle interacting with 
online services and are at risk of being left behind and left out of society  
•Those with an impairment are less likely to be online and are:
‒1.5 times more likely to struggle interacting with the NHS
‒2.2 times more likely to have difficulty interacting with charities providing 
support
‒2.5 times more likely to have difficulty interacting with housing associations

What would you recommend as the 
best way to improve internet skills?
1.Amongst those in education?
2.In developed countries?
3.In the least developed countries?
4.What would you recommend for the older population?

UK digital skills example: Universal Credit
•Universal credit replaced six different welfare benefits and aims to 
make claiming easier
•You can make a claim for Universal Credit only online
•It is an example of a “digital by default” benefit
•Newspaper and social media stories cited hardship owing to digital 
exclusion and long waits
•Charities such as Good Things Foundation offer basic digital skills 
resources online

Scotland’s Digital Inclusion Charter
•Aimed at organisations  of all 
kinds ( public, private or 
voluntary sector) to encourage 
them to sign up and recognise 
what they’re doing to promote 
digital inclusion in Scotland
•They estimate around 700,000 
people can’t currently access 
the internet, thus excluding 
them from the benefits of 
being online

Accenture initiative, UK  example
•In September 2024, Accenture announced a new initiative to help 
tackle the UK’s digital inclusion gap called “Regenerative AI”
•Between 2024 and 2027, Accenture hopes Regenerative AI will 
bring community partners and organisations together with 
volunteers from Accenture to help over a million people build their AI 
skills
•The series of programmes aims to enable people in 
socioeconomically disadvantaged communities to access devices, 
data and AI literacy courses

Age and digital exclusion, UK  example
•A study by Hu and Qian (2021) assessed social interactions across 
households and mental wellbeing during the pandemic
•They found that an older person who had only virtual contact during 
lockdown experienced greater loneliness and negative mental 
health impacts than an older person who had no contact with other 
people at all
•The problem was that older people unfamiliar with technology found 
it so stressful to learn how to use it, that it was more damaging to 
their mental health than simply coping with isolation and loneliness
