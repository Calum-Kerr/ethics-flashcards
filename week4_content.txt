To-day’s lecture is about
•The Internet and democracy
•Internet shut downs around the world
•Internet freedom around the world
•Russian censorship example
•e-Government 
•Taiwan’s digital -based open government example
Is the internet a democratic or anti -
democratic technology?
•The arguments for and against focus on the redistribution vs the 
concentration of power through access to information
•Information = knowledge, and knowledge = ability to make 
decisions
•Decision making that allows self -determination is the fundamental 
basis of democracy5

Can be considered “democratic” 
because it
•Allows individuals, civic groups and journalists to be 
producers and distributors of information
•Often by -passes traditional mass media to distribute 
information ( eg, spreading plans to stage protests/crowd 
sourcing news and pictures at the same demos)
•Facilitates the formation of interest group associations 
independent of the limitations of geography, eg, #metoo
•Provides access to a broader range of sources of 
information 
Can be considered “undemocratic” 
because
•It facilitates one-to-many communication which is not always 
unmediated (ie, it can be intercepted before it reaches the consumer)
•Already powerful institutions ( eg, governments, media organisations ) 
can use the internet to consolidate and gain new kinds of power
•Potential surveillance capacity of the internet lends itself to 
undemocratic or totalitarian uses
•Freedom on the net is a corollary of social and political freedom
•Much of our online experience is dominated by a handful of wealthy and 
powerful tech companies who are not made responsible for the material 
promoted and amplified on their platforms7

Social media platforms’ responsibility
•At the inception of the internet, the WELL (Whole Earth ' Lectronic Link) 
precursor to social media to communicate and share knowledge in a 
spirit of goodwill had few users and unwritten rules of behaviour
•As more people went online, they disregarded this etiquette
•Two test cases in the US deemed that if a company edited/censored its 
users’ posts to remove misinformation/indecency/libelous claims, it 
would be a publisher and legally responsible for users’ posts and could 
be sued, 
•If the company left its users’ posts unedited or unchallenged, it would 
simply be a platform, not legally liable
Section 230 (US law)
•US Communications Decency Act, Title V of the Telecommunications 
Act, 1996 
•This law, enacted before the major social media platforms were 
invented, has effectively dissuaded platforms from removing offensive, 
obscene or untrue content before it is published, giving power without 
responsibility 
•No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated 
as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another 
information content provider.9

Access to news –Australian example
•Australia has taken legislative steps to require tech platforms to 
negotiate with news organisations to re-distribute news in order to “level 
the playing field for public interest journalism in the digital age”
•The Australian competition watchdog has so far not needed to 
designate a digital platform’s involvement with news organisations to 
reveal the relationship’s terms
•Instead, Meta and Google have voluntarily negotiated payments to 
news organisations such as ABC, SBS and Nine Entertainment
•The resulting income has been used to fund extra journalists, including 
reporters in areas which previously had none

Fig 2: Global internet freedom declined for the 12th consecutive year
Freedom on the Net global statistics
•Global internet freedom declined 
for the 12th consecutive year in 
2022
•The sharpest decline occurred in 
Russia (now in 5thlowest place)
•China is in lowest place, followed 
by Myanmar and Iran
•Iceland ranks top for internet 
freedom, the US is 9th, the UK and 
Taiwan are tied in joint 5thplace
•The Gambia and Zimbabwe 
experienced major improvements

Internet in Russia
•Roskomnadzor (RKN), Russia’s media and telecommunications 
regulator, requires internet service providers to install a unique, 
government -produced deep packet inspection (DPI) system that 
enables the blocking of websites across the country
•The Kremlin has used this system to block global social media 
platforms, Ukrainian news sites, and domestic sites that carry any 
hint of dissent regarding its invasion of Ukraine
•The coverage period also featured increased Russian blocking of 
websites that host LGBT+ content
•Russia scores 21/100 for internet freedom according to Freedom 
House (2024), compared to 78/100 for Taiwan
Internet in Russia
•Although Google is available in Russia, it is not as popular as the 
Russian -based market leader, Yandex
•Yandex is the most visited website in Russia
•Like Google, Yandex offers also cloud storage, email, music streaming, 
online payments, maps , etc
•Russia’s biggest social media site with over 75% market share is VK 
(Vkontakte ) which offers private messaging and sharing photos, status 
updates, links with friends, communities, video and music streaming, 
and news
•Also popular is the free email service mail.ru
•As of September 2022, roughly six months after the invasion of Ukraine, 
around 1.2 million internet sites were blocked in Russia15

Internet freedom in Russia
•Roskomnadzor (RKN) is a Kremlin -established agency responsible for 
monitoring and policing electronic media, mass communications, 
information technology and telecommunications
•In September 2023, Roskomnadzor issued a statement that Russia 
would block WhatsApp if it disseminated “prohibited information”
•During the past year, the Russian government continued restricting 
access to popular censorship circumvention tools such as Virtual Private 
Network (VPN) services and anonymizers
•This has further undermined the ability of people in Russia to access 
information arbitrarily blocked by RKN
Data privacy in Russia
•Since the invasion of Ukraine in March 2022, Russian authorities have 
expanded their control over people’s biometric data, including by 
collecting such data from banks
•Russian authorities have expanded the use of facial recognition 
technology to surveil and persecute activists, particularly those opposing 
the war in Ukraine and opposing Vladimir Putin17

If all democracy is now digital democracy, what 
kind of digital democracy do we want?
Internet shutdowns
•An internet shutdown is an intentional disruption of the internet or 
digital communications, which makes those services inaccessible by a 
specific population 
•The campaigning non -profit organisation Access Now says it’s “to exert 
control over the flow of information”
•Access Now’s mission statement is “We defend and extend the digital 
rights of users at risk around the world”
•Access Now’s “ KeepItOn ” campaign pushes against internet 
shutdowns19

Internet shutdowns
•Internet shutdowns lead to economic losses arising from the disruption 
of all aspects of business operations
•They also harm the informal economy, as digital transactions and the 
flow of capital enabled by social media platforms are halted
•Deliberate internet shutdowns cost the global economy $24bn in 2022
following 114 major outages across 23 countries (Top10VPN, 2023)
•The most common internet shutdown methods include ordering ISPs to 
implement multiple localised shutdowns (easier when the ISP is state 
controlled);  DNS poisoning to render a website or app “invisible”
•Border Gateway Protocol hijacking deliberately routes internet traffic 
away from websites; individual users can be targeted and censored 
through deep packet inspection
The Internet in Iran
•Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and YouTube are all blocked or filtered, 
plus major blog -hosting platforms like Wix, WordPress, Blogspot, and 
Blogger; Iran has an internet freedom rating of 11/100 ( Freedom House, 
2024)
•Iran’s internet backbone is highly centralised, which allows authorities to 
restrict connectivity
•The telecommunications industry is tightly controlled by the government
•Following the death of Mahsa Amini custody in September 2022, 
authorities implemented multiple internet shutdowns and mobile 
disruptions
•On the first anniversary of her death, the government ordered disruption 
of the internet and mobile networks to prevent people organising further 
protests21

Internet shutdowns in South Asia
•Pakistan has shut down its internet during the 2024 general election
•Myanmar has shut down its Internet outages often since its military coup
•India, though nominally the world’s largest democracy (in 2022 it 
improved its Freedom on the Net ranking slightly following four 
consecutive years of decline) regularly imposes localised internet 
shutdowns during protests with central government tacit approval
•In India, digital activism has driven important social debates and at times 
has helped usher in policy changes
•Paradoxically, its government is driving a campaign for “ Digital India ” 
which includes initiatives to improve connectivity in rural areas, to 
address the severe urban -rural and gender digital divides
e-Government definitions
•The European Commission defines e -government as “using the 
tools and systems made possible by ICTs to provide better public 
services to citizens and businesses”
•The World Bank’s definition of e -Government is “the government 
owned or operated systems of ICTs that transform relations with 
citizens, the  private sector and/or other government agencies so 
as to promote citizens’ empowerment, improve service delivery, 
strengthen accountability, increase transparency, or improve 
government efficiency” (2001) 23

The nature and purpose of e -Government
•The concept of e -government is for communication, transaction, and 
relationship between a government, its citizens, private sector, 
ministries and government departments, and its employees 
•Communication enables online access to government and local 
authority information about services
•Transaction allows online payment to government and local authorities 
for services
•Relationship encourages active participation by the public in helping 
government to deliver good services
Internet freedom in Taiwan
•Taiwan ranks 6thin the world for internet freedom, and has one of the 
freest Internet environments in Asia
•However, internet freedom has declined this year due to concerns about 
overly broad and opaque website blocking
•Freedom House commends Taiwan’s civil society, technology sector, 
and government for taking innovative actions to counteract the negative 
impact of disinformation campaigns from China
•The Freedom House 2023 report notes that criminal prosecutions of 
online activities and concerns about excessive surveillance threaten 
Internet freedom in Taiwan25

•Taiwan originated the "g0v" (gov -zero) movement, a decentralised civic 
tech community with information transparency, open results and open 
cooperation as its core values
•Taiwan’s government is promoting citizen -led fact -checking and public 
opinion collation
•Taiwan has implemented “participation officers” (POs) to increase 
openness in transparency across all government agencies
•Their most important task is to assist public sector organisations to 
listen to the opinions of the public, and plan cross -agency policies in co -
operation with them
•POs have skills in public communication, be familiar with policy content, 
and make good use of web tools e-Government example: Taiwan

Taiwan’s open government definitions
•Transparency : “Politics is everyone's business, and the policy process 
should allow the public to have a clear understanding of "what's going 
on”.”
•Participation : “the public is given the opportunity to participate in 
discussions, express opinions, and even further influence the content 
of policy on topics of interest.”
•Accountability : “When the public has doubts about the process of 
policy formation, we can look back to see what are the reasons”
•Inclusion : “if the public sector is able to allow the various stakeholders 
who are directly affected by policy to fully voice their views and able to 
listen to their dialogues, it can collect as many views as possible to 
reduce the likelihood of policy errors.”
Many factors influence the public’s acceptance of and willingness to 
use e -Government, including:
•Data security
•Accessibility to information and services
•Privacy
•Transparency
•Economic factors
•Education
•Trust in the governmentAchieving successful e -Government29
