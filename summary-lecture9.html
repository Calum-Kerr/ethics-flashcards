            <h2>Defining a Profession</h2>
            <p>A profession is characterized by a body of specialized knowledge acquired through extensive education or formal training. It is regulated by standards of practice and ethical considerations that are embedded within the professional identity. Professions exist to serve the broader needs of society, whether through promoting justice, health, safety, or well-being.</p>
            
            <h3>Core Characteristics of Professions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monopoly of expertise:</strong> Entry into the profession is restricted and monitored by a collective body</li>
                <li><strong>Self-regulation:</strong> The profession maintains its own internal oversight through ethical codes and disciplinary systems</li>
                <li><strong>Public trust:</strong> Professionals are accountable not just to clients or employers but to society at large</li>
                <li><strong>Legal or charter-based establishment:</strong> Many professions are legally constituted entities, often through a Royal Charter or legislation</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical foundations:</strong> Integrity, responsibility, and accountability are central tenets that define professional behaviour</li>
                <li><strong>Commitment to lifelong learning:</strong> Professionals must regularly update their skills through Continuing Professional Development (CPD)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Is Computing a Profession?</h2>
            <p>Unlike traditional professions such as medicine or law, computing does not currently require formal licensure or membership in a professional body for most roles. Individuals can enter the field with varied levels of training, ranging from academic degrees to self-taught expertise or vocational certifications. There is no unified, legally recognized code of ethics that governs all computing practitioners, nor is there a single licensing authority.</p>
            
            <h3>Comparing Computing with Traditional Professions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Computing roles remain largely unregulated in most jurisdictions</li>
                <li>Titles such as "software engineer" or "IT consultant" are not protected by law</li>
                <li>Professional bodies like the British Computer Society (BCS) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) provide ethical guidelines, but adherence is generally voluntary</li>
                <li>Computing professionals have not yet attained equivalent societal recognition or expectations as doctors or lawyers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Problems Defining Core Body of Knowledge</h2>
            <p>Unlike traditional professions with well-defined curricula and licensure requirements, computing encompasses a broad and evolving set of disciplines that resist simplification. The field is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing from electrical engineering, mathematics, information systems, cognitive science, and design. The pace of innovation creates significant variability in curricula across universities and training providers.</p>
            
            <h3>Specialization and Fragmentation</h3>
            <p>Most computing-related degrees follow a "core-plus-specialism" structure, where students study general computing concepts before diverging into specific tracks. What one university considers "core" computing knowledge might be treated as optional elsewhere. In response to shifting market demands, universities may prioritize immediately employable skills over theoretical underpinnings or ethical reasoning.</p>
            
            <h3>Industry Certifications</h3>
            <p>In the absence of a universally agreed academic curriculum, industry certifications have emerged as alternatives for validating computing expertise. While they offer practical, skills-based assessments, most certifications are narrowly focused on vendor-specific technologies and do not promote understanding of underlying theoretical concepts. They typically omit ethical, legal, and societal considerations.</p>
            
            <h2>Skills in the Computing Profession</h2>
            
            <h3>Hard Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Proficiency in languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript</li>
                <li><strong>Database expertise:</strong> Understanding how to design and manage databases</li>
                <li><strong>Networking and system administration:</strong> Managing or troubleshooting networked systems</li>
                <li><strong>Development methodologies:</strong> Knowledge of Agile, Scrum, or DevOps</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Conveying complex technical information clearly to specialists and non-technical stakeholders</li>
                <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Engaging with cross-functional teams from different cultural or disciplinary backgrounds</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-solving and critical thinking:</strong> Identifying root causes of technical problems and weighing alternatives</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Remaining open to new tools, methodologies, and domains</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Under-Representation in Computing</h2>
            <p>Under-representation refers to the persistent and significant under-involvement of certain demographic groups in computingâ€”most notably women, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities. These disparities reflect deeply embedded inequalities across the educational pipeline and professional landscape.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Under-Representation Matters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equity and social justice:</strong> Patterns of exclusion mirror and reinforce broader societal inequalities</li>
                <li><strong>Impacts on technological design:</strong> Homogeneous teams may create technologies that reflect a narrow worldview and reproduce social biases</li>
                <li><strong>Economic and innovation losses:</strong> Excluding capable individuals limits both social impact and economic potential</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical accountability:</strong> Without inclusive participation, technologies governing public life may lack moral insight and legitimacy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Women in IT</h3>
            <p>Despite the growing demand for computing professionals, women continue to be significantly underrepresented in the field. In the UK, only around 21% of computing undergraduates identified as female in 2021. Women are less likely to progress into senior technical or leadership roles and more likely to exit the profession mid-career. This gender disparity is shaped by structural, cultural, and institutional forces, including gendered socialization, lack of early exposure, stereotype threat, biased recruitment practices, and non-inclusive workplace cultures.</p>
