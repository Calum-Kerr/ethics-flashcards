Last week
•We defined ethics and discussed the reasons why, as 
technological innovations appear, there is a need to ask 
ethical questions; we discussed differing views of the 
relationship between technology and society
This week
•We examine several schools of ethical thinking and 
philosophical perspectives which guide how we might use 
technology in a morally sound way

--- Page 6 ---

This lecture is about:
•Practical ethics and the dialectic method as a basis for reasoned 
argument
Traditions of ethical thought:
•Rule-based / religion -based ethics
•Consequentialist schools of ethical thought
— Utilitarianism
— Egoism
— Altruism 
•Deontology

Our discussion so far…
•We have determined that we should  examine the relationship 
between technology and society, not just assume (simplistic or 
cowardly) deterministic or neutral standpoints
•Examining the morality of the issues around technology means 
taking a stand on what is right or wrong from a human 
perspective – because humans are more important than things 
•We must ask practical ethical questions : “What is good about 
this technology beyond its utility?”, “Is the impact of this 
technology unfair?” “Just because we can build a technology, 
does it mean we have  to?”
•To determine what is right or wrong in any given subject, we 
should examine the case, question, topic or situation for its 
underlying principle first

Practical ethics      theories of ethics
•We must connect the principle or value to a particular 
situation and consider arguments for various courses of 
action or decisions
•The dialectic method examines situations to discover their 
underlying ethical issues
•This creates a kind of Socratic dialogue (though Socrates 
did it through questioning)
•When we realise  what the ethical problem is, there are 
different perspectives or traditions of ethical thought we can 
use to decide what is the right or moral course of action

Traditions of ethical thought: 
rules based ethics
In this tradition, bad actions can be avoided by means of a set of 
rules, e.g. the ten commandments (Jewish and Christian) below, or 
other religious rules
1.You shall have no other gods before Me
2.You shall make no idols
3.You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain
4.Keep the Sabbath day holy
5.Honour  your father and your mother

Traditions of ethical thought: 
rules based ethics
6.You shall not murder
7.You shall not commit adultery
8.You shall not steal
9.You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour
10.You shall not covet
•It is arguably difficult to generalise  these ancient rules to the complex 
ethical problems faced in the modern computer world
•On what moral basis would we devise rules for new situations ( eg, is it 
right to intercept e -mail? Is using a drone to drop bombs “better”?)

•Also known as teleological  theories, they consider the 
consequences  of an action as a measure of goodness
•They contrast with deontological theories, which emphasise  the 
rightness of an action above the goodness it produces
•In Consequentialism, the right action is understood entirely in terms 
of consequences produced: three schools of thought are 
Utilitarianism, Altruism and Egoism
•The most important, Utilitarianism, had early proponents in 18th 
century philosophers, David Hume and Francis HutchesonConsequentialist schools of ethical 
thought

--- Page 12 ---

•Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711 -1776) rejected religion in 
favour  of basing moral judgements on consequences and proof, 
rather than intuition or conscience; in this respect, ethics is an 
extension of empiricism
•If an act is vicious, its viciousness is a matter of the (observable) 
human response to the act
•His views influenced UtilitarianismConsequentialist schools of ethical 
thought

--- Page 13 ---

•Francis Hutcheson (1694 -1746) was a Scots -Irish philosopher  
based in Glasgow and leading member of the Scottish 
Enlightenment
•“That action is best, which procures the greatest happiness for the 
greatest numbers” (Hutcheson, 1725); the test or criterion of right 
action is its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind
•Hutcheson anticipated the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham – and 
not only in principle, but even in the use of the phrase "the greatest 
happiness for the greatest number”Consequentialist schools of ethical 
thought

Consequentialist schools of ethics: 
Utilitarianism 
•Jeremy Bentham (1748 -1832) was an English philosopher, and arguably 
the greatest proponent of Utilitarianism
•Utilitarianism evaluates actions based on their consequences for overall 
happiness, and the good of an action is in the utility it produces, not in the 
action itself 
•“Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote the greatest 
pleasure or happiness” (John Stuart Mill, 1863)
•Utilitarianism is also distinguished by impartiality and agent -neutrality: 
everyone's happiness counts the same, eg, my good counts for no more 
than anyone else's good

--- Page 15 ---

Consequentialist schools of ethics: 
Egoism
•This theory puts an individual’s interests above every other 
consideration 
•Ethical egoism claims “I morally ought to perform some action if, and 
only if, and because, performing that action maximises  my self -interest”
•Any action is good as long as it maximises  an individual’s happiness
•What distinguishes Egoism from Utilitarianism is the scope of the 
relevant consequences. (In the utilitarian view one ought to maximise  
the overall good — that is, consider the good of others as well as one's 
own good, and neither is more important than the other)

--- Page 16 ---

Consequentialist schools of ethics: 
Altruism
•In altruism, an action is right if it is favourable  to all except the actor
•Altruistic acts need not involve self -sacrifice, and they remain altruistic 
even when they are performed from a mixture of motives, some of which 
are disinterested and some self-interested
•Reciprocal  altruists display that behaviour towards those from whom 
they have received it, or from whom they expect to receive it ( eg, a quid 
pro quo)
•Universal  altruism, often seen as the central ethical prescription of 
Christianity, is unconditional

--- Page 17 ---

Traditions of Ethical Thought: Deontology 
•This term derives from Greek ‘ deon ’ = duty
•Stresses duties, rights and ethics of actions per se
•Examines whether an action is morally right or wrong in itself, 
irrespective of its consequences
•Importance is attached to the motive of a decision
•Immanuel Kant (1724 -1804), German philosopher, is the most important 
proponent of deontological, or duty based, ethics – that the sole feature 
that gives an action moral worth is not the outcome that is achieved by 
the action, but the motive that is behind the action 

--- Page 18 ---

Traditions of Ethical Thought: Deontology 
•Within the domain of moral theories that assess our choices, 
deontologists stand in opposition to consequentialists
•Immanuel Kant is known for his theory that there is a single moral 
obligation, which he called the "Categorical Imperative" 
•Kant’s categorical imperative is “always act out of respect for the moral 
law”
•For Kant, categorical imperatives are principles that are intrinsically valid; 
they are good in and of themselves; they must be obeyed in all, and by 
all, situations and circumstances if our behaviour is to observe the moral 
law

--- Page 19 ---

•Different societies, organisations and individuals have different 
moral values and espouse different ethical stances at different times
•There are few absolute rules
•Individual belief sets may be inherited from family, friends, 
workplace culture etc
•There are therefore no absolutes - “Ethical Relativism”
•The dialectic method does not always lead to a definitive conclusion 
about what should be done or what was wrong, but almost always 
leads towards achieving objectivity and better understanding Ethics in practice

Including ethics in your coursework
•For your coursework, you must incorporate ethical theory 
into your chosen title’s literature review
•First you need to determine what is problematic or morally 
or ethically wrong in the subject by an initial reading round 
the subject generally ( eg, Wikipedia, newspaper articles)
•Next, use Google Scholar, Web of Science and the Library 
Catalogue to find refereed journal articles that a) inform the 
reader about some aspect of the topic and b) build up a 
range of different angles or perspectives on the ethical 
problem(s)

--- Page 21 ---

Including ethics in your coursework
•Some journal articles will explicitly mention ethical theories, 
but many don’t; you need to read carefully to work out if the 
authors’ views are influenced by technological determinism
•What is right or good from a Utilitarian, altruistic, egoistic 
perspective? What is right or good from the opposing 
Deontological perspective? 
•Try to explore all sides of your topic informatively and 
backed up by evidence from references
•To give your coursework the correct theoretical content, 
use the ethical standpoints and philosophical traditions 
from lectures 1 and 2
