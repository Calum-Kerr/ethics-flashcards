            {
                question: "What is training data bias and what are its types?",
                answer: "Bias that occurs when training data is not representative of the real world. Types include selection bias, coverage bias, non-response bias, sampling bias, and out-group homogeneity bias."

            {
                question: "What is method bias in algorithms?",

                question: "What is societal bias in algorithms?",

                question: "What is the Robo-debt scandal and what biases did it demonstrate?",
                answer: "An Australian automated system for identifying welfare overpayments that resulted in many false debt notices. It demonstrated data bias (overgeneralization), method bias (using averages instead of actual earnings), and societal bias (targeting marginalized people and shifting burden of proof)."

                question: "Why is computing not fully recognized as a profession like medicine or law?",
                answer: "Computing does not require formal licensure or membership in a professional body for most roles, has no unified legally recognized code of ethics, no single licensing authority, and titles like 'software engineer' are not protected by law."
